-> by default first four parameters of the function are passed to the registers
-> Remaining algorithms are pushed on the stack (right-to-left order)

Registers to which first 4 parameters are passed due to data type:
- int	- RCX, RDX, R8, R9
- float - XMM0 - XMM3
- _m128 types are never passed by immediate value. Instead, a pointer is passed to the memory allocated
by the caller.
